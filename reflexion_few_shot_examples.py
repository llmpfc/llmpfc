Example 1:

Consider the following puzzle problem:
	Problem description:
	- There are three lists labeled A, B, and C.
	- There are three numbers -- 0, 1, and 2 -- distributed among those three lists.
	- You can only move numbers from the rightmost end of one list to the rightmost end of another list.
	Goal: The goal is to end up in the configuration where all numbers are in list C, in ascending order.
	Rule #1: You can only move a number if it is at the rightmost end of its current list.
	Rule #2: You can only move a number to the rightmost end of a list if it is larger than the other numbers in that list.

	This is the starting configuration:
	A = [0, 1, 2]
	B = []
	C = []
	This is the goal configuration:
	A = []
	B = []
	C = [0, 1, 2]

	Give me only the next move from the starting configuration, that would help in reaching the goal configuration using as few moves as possible. 
	Your answer should be in the format as below:
	Move <N> from list <src> to list <trg>.

Timed out. Couldn't solve problem in 50 steps. Total reward = -230

New Plan: I was stuck in a loop where I continually moved 1 from A to C, then took invalid moves that violate Rule #2, and finally moved 1 from C to A. I should have tried moving 2 from B to C, which satisfies both Rule #1 and Rule #2. I will try to take a different valid move that satisfies both Rule #1 and Rule #2 if I am stuck in a loop again. 


Example 2:

Consider the following puzzle problem:
	Problem description:
	- There are three lists labeled A, B, and C.
	- There are three numbers -- 0, 1, and 2 -- distributed among those three lists.
	- You can only move numbers from the rightmost end of one list to the rightmost end of another list.
	Goal: The goal is to end up in the configuration where all numbers are in list C, in ascending order.
	Rule #1: You can only move a number if it is at the rightmost end of its current list.
	Rule #2: You can only move a number to the rightmost end of a list if it is larger than the other numbers in that list.

	This is the starting configuration:
	A = [2]
	B = []
	C = [0, 1]
	This is the goal configuration:
	A = []
	B = []
	C = [0, 1, 2]

	Give me only the next move from the starting configuration, that would help in reaching the goal configuration using as few moves as possible. 
	Your answer should be in the format as below:
	Move <N> from list <src> to list <trg>.

Timed out. Couldn't solve problem in 50 steps. Total reward = -170

New Plan: In this problem 0 and 1 were in list C in the starting configuration, and their positions in list C matched the goal configuration. I shouldn't have tried moving 0 and 1 from list C. I should have tried moving 2 from A to C, which should have solved the problem in just a single move. I will try to not move numbers that are already in the correct positions in list C according to the goal configuration. 
	

Example 3:

Consider the following puzzle problem:
	Problem description:
	- There are three lists labeled A, B, and C.
	- There are three numbers -- 0, 1, and 2 -- distributed among those three lists.
	- You can only move numbers from the rightmost end of one list to the rightmost end of another list.
	Goal: The goal is to end up in the configuration where all numbers are in list C, in ascending order.
	Rule #1: You can only move a number if it is at the rightmost end of its current list.
	Rule #2: You can only move a number to the rightmost end of a list if it is larger than the other numbers in that list.

	This is the starting configuration:
	A = [0, 2]
	B = [1]
	C = []
	This is the goal configuration:
	A = []
	B = []
	C = [0, 1, 2]

	Give me only the next move from the starting configuration, that would help in reaching the goal configuration using as few moves as possible. 
	Your answer should be in the format as below:
	Move <N> from list <src> to list <trg>.

Solved problem in 13 steps. Total reward = 57

New Plan: I solved this problem in 13 steps, but I could have solved this problem in fewer steps by not taking invalid moves that don't satisfy Rule #1 and Rule #2. I started with moving 2 from A to C. However though it is a valid move and satisfies both Rule #1 and Rule #2, I should have first moved 2 from A to B. This would have allowed me to then move 0 from A to C, and I could have solved the problem efficiently using fewer steps. I will try to take valid moves that help me reach the goal configuration quickly.

#In this environment, my plan was to find a saltshaker and then put it on a cabinet. I successfully found the saltshaker on shelf 1 and took it. However, I failed to put the saltshaker on cabinet 1. In the next trial, I will ensure that I properly execute the action to place the saltshaker on the cabinet. If the action fails, I will try a different cabinet or rephrase the action command.

#In this environment, my plan was to find a saltshaker and then put it on a cabinet. I successfully found the saltshaker on shelf 1 and took it. However, I failed to put the saltshaker on any of the cabinets despite trying multiple cabinets and rephrasing the action command. In the next trial, I will ensure that I properly execute the action to place the saltshaker on the cabinet. If the action fails, I will try a different cabinet or rephrase the action command. Additionally, I will consider the possibility that the task may require placing the saltshaker inside a cabinet rather than on top of it.
